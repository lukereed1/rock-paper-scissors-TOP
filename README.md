# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors

## General Info

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with a user interface. The user can play against the computer by selecting one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer will make a random selection. The winner of the round will be determined based on the standard rules of the game and the score will be displayed on the screen. Developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of Javascript, mainly focusing on functions, conditionals and DOM manipulation. As well as practicing a bit of HTML and CSS.
